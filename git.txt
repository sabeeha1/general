Working with git on command made some issues that are completely resovled at pycharm.

So here,
1: first I crteated a repository at the github
2: followed all the commands suggested by github at the front page.
  These command were to run on the local system in the main directory:
  - git init
  - making README.md file
  - git add -A
  - git remote add origin "git/repo/http/link"
  - git commit -m "Initial commit or special log"
  - Now push with Pycharm button
Thus push action makes trouble using command line, So it is very straight using pycharm button.

TO ignore some files or directories in push operation , we can add .gitignore file

And later, these files will not be uploaded up in the repo.
>to remove any file
: git rm filename

If some command doesn't go as expected, may be it is due to cache problem, so we may use the follwing command to cler the cache
: git rm -r --cached .

Like .gitignore was not working my case, but after this command it did.

WORKING IN BRANCHES
------------------------------------------------

If we are working in team, it is safe to use branches to work unless everyhting is fixed completely.
So, i checked the branch position using
> git branch

Now I craete a new branch using:
> git branch <branch-name>
check gaian the branches
> git branch

Now checkout to the new branch

> git checkout <branch name>

Can verify, working branch by using
> git branch
** now make make changes securily and do commit in local branch

>git commit -m "testing new branch"

** Once everything is finalized, come in the master branch

>git checkout master
>git branch --merged
** give the following command to merge the branches changes with master branch
>git merge test2-1
